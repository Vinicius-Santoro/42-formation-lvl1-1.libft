### _Project 1 - Libft First project for the formation of software engineers at school 42 São Paulo_

- This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions.
- My functions’ names must be prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes
ft_strlen.

### _The project consists of three parts_
- In the first part, i recoded a set of the libc functions, as defined in their
manual.
- In the second part, i coded a set of functions that are either not included in the
libc.
- In the third part (bonus), i created functions to manipulate lists.
